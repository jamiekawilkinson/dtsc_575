# DTSC 575: Principles of Python Programming

This repository contains all programming assignments and projects completed in DTSC 575.

**Course Description:** This course will teach students the introductory skills of programming, problem solving, and algorithmic thinking in Python. Topics include variables, input/output, conditional statements/logic, Boolean expressions, flow control, loops and functions. Approachable for students who have no experience with Python.

## Project Descriptions:

1. array.py: Create a program called array.py that has a function that takes four integer arguments.  Those arguments should be put into an Numpy array.  The function will have two print statements.  The first will print the type of the array you create (which should be <class ‘numpy.ndarray’>).  The second will print the multiplication of the four items in your array. 

2. capcount.py: Create a program called capCount.py that has a function that takes in a string and prints the number of capital letters in the first line, then prints the sum of their indices in the second line.
